# Hunger Free City - native projects started by Mirek Chowaniok
Connecting people to the needs of Community.

Hunger Free City provides easy way to find out what the needs of your local community are. Food Banks list top needed items, so that users, when they are shopping for donations items, can understand what the real needs are.
